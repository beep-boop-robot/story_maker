# Creating a game

![Hello World!](gifs/helloworld.gif)


A game is comprised of one or more scenes. The scenes will be played in the roder that they appear in the `Scenes` tab, from top to bottom.

There is a 2 second wait between the end of one scene and the start of the next scene. At the end of the last scene the game will not exit.

Add images to a scene using the `Images` tab. See [this](./images.md) for interacting with images.

Add dialogue and custom logic to the scene using the graph at the bottom of the screen. See [this](./dialogue.md) for more info.
